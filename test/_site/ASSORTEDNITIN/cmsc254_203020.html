<li>It is expected that you will spend at least 12 hours a week on this class completing readings / related activities, and programming outside of scheduled lab and lectures. For every credit hour it is expected that students are putting in 3-4 hours of work. This is a 4-credit class.</li>
<li>In-class activities cannot be made up; you must be present to complete the activity and earn a grade for it. In general, we have activities every class meeting.</li>
<li>This class has a dedicated lab time and lab assistance is available only during this time. If you choose not to attend the lab, you are responsible for completing/debugging the lab on your own. It is recommended that you prepare for labs by reading through the module’s assigned readings and lab instructions before the start of lab to make efficient use of the time.</li>
<li>All programming assignments must be uploaded to Gradescope on or before the due date specified. Only files submitted on or before the due date will be considered for grading unless an extension was granted prior to the due date. In all circumstances, an assignment will not be accepted after it has been reviewed and a solution presented in class.</li>
<li>Requests to re-grade any assignment or assessment must be made within one week from the date the project grade is posted in Canvas, requests after this time will be denied.</li>
<li>No assignments will be accepted late unless special permission has been given prior to the due date. In all circumstances, an assignment will not be accepted after it has been reviewed and a solution presented in class.</li>
<li>No makeup exams or quizzes will be given unless special permission has been given prior to the date of the test. Be prepared to provide documentation for the reason you are requesting the makeup exam, or permission may not be granted.</li>
<li>Request to adjust scores or re-grade tests must be made within one week after the test results are released, requests after this time will be denied.</li>
<li>All programming projects are to be individual efforts. Plagiarism applies to source code as with any other intellectual property. Plagiarized code is a form of cheating and will be treated as such. 1. Instances of plagiarism and other violations of the VCU Honor Code will be reported to the VCU Honor Council.</li>
<li>Personal computers/laptops/cell phone may be used in class only with the instructor’s permission.</li>
<li>Use of any electronic device is prohibited during exams. Students may not leave the exam room once testing begins for any reason. Violations of these class rules will result in a grade of zero (0) for the exam.</li>

<section id="course-standards-for-cheating-and-plagiarism" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="course-standards-for-cheating-and-plagiarism">Course Standards for Cheating and Plagiarism</h2>
<p>It is important that the work you hand in is your own. It is fairly easy to copy someone else’s program (especially as the due date approaches). For you to learn the material in order to perform well on the tests and subsequent programs and courses, it is imperative that you understand everything that is in your program.</p>
<p>Obtaining verbal assistance on assignments is allowed. This means that you may discuss algorithms. You may not view or discuss written algorithms or code with anyone other than your instructor or course teaching assistants.</p>
<p>Remember, programming is a learn-by-doing skill. The programming assignments are key tools for learning the material in the course. Doing the programming projects as “group projects” is strictly prohibited, an honor code violation, and will invariably lead to you performing poorly in the course.</p>
<p>Just make sure that the work you hand in is truly yours. Three simple guidelines to insure this are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The “form of expression” must be original.</li>
<li>Understand everything in your program.</li>
<li>Never copy files from someone else, never give files to someone else, never examine someone else’s code, never debug someone else’s code, never show someone else your code.</li>
</ol>
<p>The internet is a great resource for finding alternate explanations or examples for programming concepts that may help you better understand the material and you are allowed and encouraged to utilize it. However, asking for specific help that is targeted towards a homework assignment or programming project on “homework help” sites, tutoring sites, blogs, or forums is considered cheating and will be reported to the VCU Honor Council for investigation. The TAs and the instructor are much better sources of assistance.</p>
<p>Code that is obtained from outside sources, such as the internet, and used in a homework submission MUST be approved by your instructor and properly cited in the code comments or it will be considered plagiarism.</p>
<p>The TAs and I will be using Gradescope’s software and Stanford University’s Moss (for Measure of Software Similarity) program to detect software plagiarism along with the measure of similarity provided by Gradescope.</p>
<p>You are reminded that all homework is pledged to be your own work as described above and it is an honor code violation to misrepresent work that is not yours. Programs that violate these standards will be immediately referred to the Honor System for action.</p>

<p>Tips for Success:</p>
<ul>
<li>When taking online and hybrid courses, your self-motivation and self-pacing are absolutely critical. For this course, you should plan to work about 9 hours per course module as we move through the materials. Be sure to plan your time accordingly.</li>
<li>Make yourself a calendar with all of your due dates across ALL of your courses. Plan for when you will work on each one for completion in advance of the due dates.</li>
<li>Make sure you note any “online” course that still have a required meeting time (such as a Google Meet or Zoom session).</li>
<li>Avoid the common assumption that online courses are easier or should be easier. That is a MYTH!!</li>

<li>Do not dominate any discussion.</li>
<li>Give other students the opportunity to join in the discussion.</li>
<li>Do not use offensive language. Present ideas appropriately.</li>
<li>Be cautious in using Internet language. For example, do not capitalize all letters since this suggests shouting.</li>
<li>Popular emoticons such as ☺ can be helpful to convey your tone but do not overdo or overuse them.</li>
<li>Never make fun of someone’s ability to read or write.</li>
<li>Share tips with other students.</li>
<li>Keep an “open-mind” and be willing to express even your academically informed opinion.</li>
<li>Think and edit before you push the “Send” button.</li>
