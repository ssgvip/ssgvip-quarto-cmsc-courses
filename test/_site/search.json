Class registration required for attendance Students may attend only those classes for which they have registered. Faculty may not add students to class rosters or Canvas. Therefore, if students are attending a class for which they have not registered, they must stop attending. Honor System: upholding academic integrity The VCU Honor System policy describes the responsibilities of students, faculty and administration in upholding academic integrity, while at the same time respecting the rights of individuals to the due process offered by administrative hearings and appeals. According to this policy, “Members of the academic community are required to conduct themselves in accordance with the highest standards of academic honesty, ethics and integrity at all times.” In addition, “To support a\ncommitment to the Honor System, all members of the VCU community are required to: • Adhere to the Honor System policy and its procedures; • Report any suspicion or knowledge of possible violations of the Honor System; • Answer truthfully when called upon to do so regarding Honor System matters; • Maintain appropriate confidentiality regarding related to Honor System matters.” More information can be found at in the VCU policy library. Managing stress Students may experience situations or challenges that can interfere with learning and interpersonal functioning including stress, anxiety, depression, alcohol and/or other drug use, concern for a friend or family member, loss, sleep difficulties, feeling hopeless or relationship problems. There are numerous campus resources available to students including University Counseling Services (804-828-6200 MPC Campus, 804-828-3964 MCV Campus), University Student Health Services (MPC 804 828- 8828, MCV Campus 804 828-9220) and the Wellness Resource Center (804-828- 9355). 24-hour emergency mental health support is available by calling 828-1234 and asking to speak to the on-call therapist or utilizing the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-784-2433). Student conduct in the classroom According to the Faculty Guide to Student Conduct in Instructional Settings, “The university is a community of learners. Students, as well as faculty, have a responsibility for creating and maintaining an environment that supports effective instruction. In order for faculty members (including graduate teaching assistants) to provide and students to receive effective instruction in classrooms, laboratories, studios, online courses, and other learning areas, the university expects students to conduct themselves in an orderly and cooperative manner.” Among other things, cell phones should be turned off while in the classroom. The Student Code of Conduct also prohibits the possession of or carrying of any weapon. For more information see http://register.dls.virginia.gov/details.aspx?id=3436. Student email policy Email is considered an official method for communication at VCU because it delivers information in a convenient, timely, cost-effective, and environmentally aware manner. Students are expected to check their official VCU email on a frequent and consistent basis in order to remain informed of university-related communications. The university recommends checking email daily. Students are responsible for the consequences of not reading, in a timely fashion, university-related communications sent to their official VCU student email account. This policy ensures that all students have access to this important form of communication. It ensures students can be reached through a standardized channel by faculty and other staff of the university as needed. Mail sent to the VCU email address may include notification of university- related actions, including disciplinary action. Please read the policy in its entirety at the VCU Policy Library. Student responsibilities (source: One VCU: Responsible Together available at: https://together.vcu.edu/students/ )\nWhen we return, things will look and feel different as we take necessary steps to protect the well-being of our community. Here is what is expected of you: 1. Monitor your health daily. Testing will occur according to protocols. 2. Wear a face covering or mask in common areas, including class. 3. Apply physical distance guidelines to all settings. 4. Clean and disinfect personal and shared spaces before and after use. 5. Cleaning supplies will be available in numerous locations. 6. Report symptoms associated with COVID-19 to VCU Student Health 7. A call center hotline will be available later in the summer. 8. Not sharing is caring during this unique pandemic. Please do not share 9. calculators, tools, lab supplies, etc. Following rules regarding face coverings or masks, cleaning and disinfecting, and physical distancing is required. Students will receive reminders for daily health monitoring. Staff in the Dean of Students office will be notified after incidents of non-compliance. Refusal to comply with rules can include progressive disciplinary action up to and including suspension, based on the VCU Student Code of Conduct. Requesting accommodations The university recognizes that some students who previously did not need Section 504 Academic Accommodations, and who have a qualifying condition or disability, may need support or assistance during the return to campus process. A modified approach for the temporary and more permanent need for accommodation has been developed and implemented to provide students with full access to programs and activities related to their academic majors. Because every case is different, student requests are evaluated on a case- by-case basis. Please share your need for an accommodation with the Student Accessibility and Education Office , or for MCV Campus students, the Division for Academic Success , after you have worked directly with your faculty member. Health and Well-being Navigating the anticipated stressors of daily life can often be challenging enough. When unexpected stressors emerge or when we are faced with uncertainty, it can be tough to know how to cope. Try out some of these tips and resources for health and wellness to see if they are a right fit for you. Symptoms or Diagnosis: If an on-campus student identifies symptoms, has tested positive for COVID-19 or has come into contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19, that student should contact University Student Health Services . At that point, isolation should begin and contact tracing will be performed by Student Health Services. Symptoms will be monitored and the student should refer to a medical provider if symptoms worsen or be released from isolation after 14 days, if symptom-free. Nondiscrimination policy VCU is committed to providing a safe, equitable and inclusive environment for all its employees, patients and students. Discrimination or discriminatory harassment is not only unlawful, it is harmful to the well-being of our university community. Our university’s core values, specifically those related to diversity and inclusion, have withstood many difficult situations and trying times, and they will not falter now. Reports of discrimination, bullying, harassment and/or stereotyping of persons of color or those impacted by COVID-19 or otherwise, will not be tolerated. Be assured that VCU will make every effort to address and prevent the occurrence of unlawful discrimination and, if\nnecessary, take prompt and appropriate action to remedy and prevent its reoccurrence. Every member of our community is asked to: • Become familiar with the university’s policies on Preventing and Responding to Discrimination and Duty to Report and Protection from Retaliation in the VCU Policy Library. • Consult with Equity and Access Services or VCU Human Resources for additional guidance on how to file a report of discrimination. • Contact the Office of Institutional Equity, Effectiveness and Success (IES) on how to address and maintain a culture of inclusion. • Encourage individuals who may need an ADA accommodation for a known or newly acquired disability, to contact the ADA/504 Coordinator in ADA Services. • Bookmark and share information on university or community agencies that offer support or services, such as VCU’s Counseling Services or Ombudsperson. • Explore training and educational opportunities on diversity and inclusion at IExcel Education and through the Office of Institutional Equity, Effectiveness and Success . • Offer nonjudgmental support and empathy to those affected by current events and this health crisis. Message from your Instructor I am grateful for your presence and input in this online course. I appreciate and welcome you regardless of your immigration status, country of origin and/or citizenship, race, ethnicity, religious affiliation, gender/sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, or dis/ability. Thank you for enriching our world, sharing your vital experience, and contributing to the diversity that makes our intellectual community vibrant and evermore creative. Tips for Success: • When taking online and hybrid courses, your self-motivation and self-pacing are absolutely critical. For this course, you should plan to work about 9 hours per course module as we move through the materials. Be sure to plan your time accordingly. • Make yourself a calendar with all of your due dates across ALL of your courses. Plan for when you will work on each one for completion in advance of the due dates. • Make sure you note any “online” course that still have a required meeting time (such as a Google Meet or Zoom session). • Avoid the common assumption that online courses are easier or should be easier. That is a MYTH!! • Plan Ahead!! Study as you go instead of at the last minute! Where to post questions Questions of general interest should first be posted to the discussion board (only if they have not already been answered) so that other students can benefit from the response or have an opportunity to respond to your question. Only questions of a private nature should be communicated to me through email. When sending a message to me, please allow a minimum of 24 hours for a response . Most of the time I will respond much faster, but sometimes meetings and other courses take over my schedule. Netiquette Guidelines\nNetiquette is a set of rules for behaving properly online. Your instructor and fellow students wish to foster a safe online learning environment. All opinions and experiences, no matter how different or controversial they may be perceived, must be respected in the tolerant spirit of academic discourse. You are encouraged to comment, question, or critique an idea but you are not to attack an individual. Working as a community of learners, we can build a polite and respectful course community. The following netiquette tips will enhance the learning experience for everyone in the course: • Do not dominate any discussion. • Give other students the opportunity to join in the discussion. • Do not use offensive language. Present ideas appropriately. • Be cautious in using Internet language.

Students will receive reminders for daily health monitoring. Staff in the Dean of Students office will be notified after incidents of non-compliance. Refusal to comply with rules can include progressive disciplinary action up to and including suspension, based on the VCU Student Code of Conduct. Requesting accommodations The university recognizes that some students who previously did not need Section 504 Academic Accommodations, and who have a qualifying condition or disability, may need support or assistance during the return to campus process. A modified approach for the temporary and more permanent need for accommodation has been developed and implemented to provide students with full access to programs and activities related to their academic majors. Because every case is different, student requests are evaluated on a case- by-case basis. Please share your need for an accommodation with the Student Accessibility and Education Office , or for MCV Campus students, the Division for Academic Success , after you have worked directly with your faculty member. Health and Well-being Navigating the anticipated stressors of daily life can often be challenging enough. When unexpected stressors emerge or when we are faced with uncertainty, it can be tough to know how to cope. Try out some of these tips and resources for health and wellness to see if they are a right fit for you. Symptoms or Diagnosis: If an on-campus student identifies symptoms, has tested positive for COVID-19 or has come into contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19, that student should contact University Student Health Services . At that point, isolation should begin and contact tracing will be performed by Student Health Services. Symptoms will be monitored and the student should refer to a medical provider if symptoms worsen or be released from isolation after 14 days, if symptom-free. Nondiscrimination policy VCU is committed to providing a safe, equitable and inclusive environment for all its employees, patients and students. Discrimination or discriminatory harassment is not only unlawful, it is harmful to the well-being of our university community. Our university’s core values, specifically those related to diversity and inclusion, have withstood many difficult situations and trying times, and they will not falter now. Reports of discrimination, bullying, harassment and/or stereotyping of persons of color or those impacted by COVID-19 or otherwise, will not be tolerated. Be assured that VCU will make every effort to address and prevent the occurrence of unlawful discrimination and, if\nnecessary, take prompt and appropriate action to remedy and prevent its reoccurrence. Every member of our community is asked to: • Become familiar with the university’s policies on Preventing and Responding to Discrimination and Duty to Report and Protection from Retaliation in the VCU Policy Library. • Consult with Equity and Access Services or VCU Human Resources for additional guidance on how to file a report of discrimination. • Contact the Office of Institutional Equity, Effectiveness and Success (IES) on how to address and maintain a culture of inclusion. • Encourage individuals who may need an ADA accommodation for a known or newly acquired disability, to contact the ADA/504 Coordinator in ADA Services. • Bookmark and share information on university or community agencies that offer support or services, such as VCU’s Counseling Services or Ombudsperson. • Explore training and educational opportunities on diversity and inclusion at IExcel Education and through the Office of Institutional Equity, Effectiveness and Success . • Offer nonjudgmental support and empathy to those affected by current events and this health crisis. Message from your Instructor I am grateful for your presence and input in this online course. I appreciate and welcome you regardless of your immigration status, country of origin and/or citizenship, race, ethnicity, religious affiliation, gender/sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, or dis/ability. Thank you for enriching our world, sharing your vital experience, and contributing to the diversity that makes our intellectual community vibrant and evermore creative. Tips for Success: • When taking online and hybrid courses, your self-motivation and self-pacing are absolutely critical. For this course, you should plan to work about 9 hours per course module as we move through the materials. Be sure to plan your time accordingly. • Make yourself a calendar with all of your due dates across ALL of your courses. Plan for when you will work on each one for completion in advance of the due dates. • Make sure you note any “online” course that still have a required meeting time (such as a Google Meet or Zoom session). • Avoid the common assumption that online courses are easier or should be easier. That is a MYTH!! • Plan Ahead!! Study as you go instead of at the last minute! Where to post questions Questions of general interest should first be posted to the discussion board (only if they have not already been answered) so that other students can benefit from the response or have an opportunity to respond to your question. Only questions of a private nature should be communicated to me through email. When sending a message to me, please allow a minimum of 24 hours for a response . Most of the time I will respond much faster, but sometimes meetings and other courses take over my schedule. Netiquette Guidelines\nNetiquette is a set of rules for behaving properly online. Your instructor and fellow students wish to foster a safe online learning environment. All opinions and experiences, no matter how different or controversial they may be perceived, must be respected in the tolerant spirit of academic discourse. You are encouraged to comment, question, or critique an idea but you are not to attack an individual. Working as a community of learners, we can build a polite and respectful course community. The following netiquette tips will enhance the learning experience for everyone in the course: • Do not dominate any discussion. • Give other students the opportunity to join in the discussion. • Do not use offensive language. Present ideas appropriately. • Be cautious in using Internet language. For example, do not capitalize all letters since this suggests shouting. • Popular emoticons such as ☺ can be helpful to convey your tone but do not overdo or overuse them. • Never make fun of someone’s ability to read or write. • Share tips with other students. • Keep an “open-mind” and be willing to express even your academically informed opinion. • Think and edit before you push the “Send” button. • Do not hesitate to ask for feedback. • Using humor is acceptable (adapted from UWSP ) Be Proactive in Communication If you find that you have any trouble keeping up with assignments or other aspects of the course, make sure you let your instructor know as early as possible.
