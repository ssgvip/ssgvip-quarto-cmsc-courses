According to this policy, \"Members of the academic community are required to conduct themselves in accordance with the highest standards of academic honesty, ethics and integrity at all times.\" In addition, “To support a commitment to the Honor System, all members of the VCU community are required to:\n\n- Adhere to the Honor System policy and its procedures;\n- Report any suspicion or knowledge of possible violations of the Honor System;\n- Answer truthfully when called upon to do so regarding Honor System matters;\n- Maintain appropriate confidentiality regarding related to Honor System\nmatters.\" More information can be found at in the VCU policy library.\n\n## Managing stress\n\nStudents may experience situations or challenges that can interfere with learning and interpersonal functioning including stress, anxiety, depression, alcohol and/or other drug use, concern for a friend or family member, loss, sleep difficulties, feeling hopeless or relationship problems. There are numerous campus resources available to students including University Counseling Services (804-828-6200 MPC Campus, 804-828-3964 MCV Campus), University Student Health Services (MPC 804 828- 8828, MCV Campus 804 828-9220) and the Wellness Resource Center (804-828- 9355). 24-hour emergency mental health support is available by calling 828-1234 and asking to speak to the on-call therapist or utilizing the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-784-2433).\n\n### Student conduct in the classroom\n\nAccording to the Faculty Guide to Student Conduct in Instructional Settings, \"The university is a community of learners. Students, as well as faculty, have a responsibility for creating and maintaining an environment that supports effective instruction. In order for faculty members (including graduate teaching assistants) to provide and students to receive effective instruction in classrooms, laboratories, studios, online courses, and other learning areas, the university expects students to conduct themselves in an orderly and cooperative manner.\" Among other things, cell phones should be turned off while in the classroom. The Student Code of Conduct also prohibits the possession of or carrying of any weapon. For more information see http://register.dls.virginia.gov/details.aspx?id=3436.\n\n### Student email policy\n\nEmail is considered an official method for communication at VCU because it delivers information in a convenient, timely, cost-effective, and environmentally aware manner. Students are expected to check their official VCU email on a frequent and consistent basis in order to remain informed of university-related communications. The university recommends checking email daily. Students are responsible for the consequences of not reading, in a timely fashion, university-related communications sent to their official VCU student email account. This policy ensures that all students have access to this important form of communication. It ensures students can be reached through a standardized channel by faculty and other staff of the university as needed. Mail sent to the VCU email address may include notification of university- related actions, including disciplinary action. Please read the policy in its entirety at the VCU Policy Library.\n\n## Student responsibilities\n\n(source: One VCU: Responsible Together available at: https://together.vcu.edu/students/ )\n \nWhen we return, things will look and feel different as we take necessary steps to protect the well-being of our community. Here is what is expected of you:\n\n1. Monitor your health daily. Testing will occur according to protocols.\n2. Wear a face covering or mask in common areas, including class.\n3. Apply physical distance guidelines to all settings.\n4. Clean and disinfect personal and shared spaces before and after use.\n5. Cleaning supplies will be available in numerous locations.\n6. Report symptoms associated with COVID-19 to VCU Student Health\n7. A call center hotline will be available later in the summer.\n8. Not sharing is caring during this unique pandemic. Please do not share calculators, tools, lab supplies, etc.\n\nFollowing rules regarding face coverings or masks, cleaning and disinfecting, and physical distancing is required. Students will receive reminders for daily health monitoring. Staff in the Dean of Students office will be notified after incidents of non-compliance. Refusal to comply with rules can include progressive disciplinary action up to and including suspension, based on the VCU Student Code of Conduct.\n\n### Requesting accommodations\n\nThe university recognizes that some students who previously did not need Section 504 Academic Accommodations, and who have a qualifying condition or disability, may need support or assistance during the return to campus process. A modified approach for the temporary and more permanent need for accommodation has been developed and implemented to provide students with full access to programs and activities related to their academic majors. Because every case is different, student requests are evaluated on a case- by-case basis. Please share your need for an accommodation with the Student Accessibility and Education Office , or for MCV Campus students, the Division for Academic Success , after you have worked directly with your faculty member.\n\n### Health and Well-being\n\nNavigating the anticipated stressors of daily life can often be challenging enough. When unexpected stressors emerge or when we are faced with uncertainty, it can be tough to know how to cope. Try out some of these tips and resources for health and wellness to see if they are a right fit for you.\n\nSymptoms or Diagnosis: If an on-campus student identifies symptoms, has tested positive for COVID-19 or has come into contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19, that student should contact University Student Health Services . At that point, isolation should begin and contact tracing will be performed by Student Health Services. Symptoms will be monitored and the student should refer to a medical provider if symptoms worsen or be released from isolation after 14 days, if symptom-free.\n\n### Nondiscrimination policy\n\nVCU is committed to providing a safe, equitable and inclusive environment for all its employees, patients and students. Discrimination or discriminatory harassment is not only unlawful, it is harmful to the well-being of our university community. Our university’s core values, specifically those related to diversity and inclusion, have withstood many difficult situations and trying times, and they will not falter now. Reports of discrimination, bullying, harassment and/or stereotyping of persons of color or those impacted by COVID-19 or otherwise, will not be tolerated. Be assured that VCU will make every effort to address and prevent the occurrence of unlawful discrimination and, if necessary, take prompt and appropriate action to remedy and prevent its reoccurrence. Every member of our community is asked to:\n- Become familiar with the university’s policies on Preventing and Responding to Discrimination and Duty to Report and Protection from Retaliation in the VCU Policy Library.\n- Consult with Equity and Access Services or VCU Human Resources for additional guidance on how to file a report of discrimination.\n- Contact the Office of Institutional Equity, Effectiveness and Success (IES) on how to address and maintain a culture of inclusion.\n- Encourage individuals who may need an ADA accommodation for a known or newly acquired disability, to contact the ADA/504 Coordinator in ADA Services.\n- Bookmark and share information on university or community agencies that offer support or services, such as VCU’s Counseling Services or Ombudsperson.\n- Explore training and educational opportunities on diversity and inclusion at IExcel Education and through the Office of Institutional Equity, Effectiveness and Success .\n- Offer nonjudgmental support and empathy to those affected by current events and this health crisis.\n\n## Message from your Instructor\n\nI am grateful for your presence and input in this online course. I appreciate and welcome you regardless of your immigration status, country of origin and/or citizenship, race, ethnicity, religious affiliation, gender/sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, or dis/ability. Thank you for enriching our world, sharing your vital experience, and contributing to the diversity that makes our intellectual community vibrant and evermore creative.\n\n### Tips for Success:\n\n- When taking online and hybrid courses, your self-motivation and self-pacing are absolutely critical. For this course, you should plan to work about 9 hours per course module as we move through the materials. Be sure to plan your time accordingly.\n- Make yourself a calendar with all of your due dates across ALL of your courses. Plan for when you will work on each one for completion in advance of the due dates.\n- Make sure you note any “online” course that still have a required meeting time (such as a Google Meet or Zoom session).\n- Avoid the common assumption that online courses are easier or should be easier. That is a MYTH!!\n- Plan Ahead!! Study as you go instead of at the last minute!\n\n### Where to post questions\n\nQuestions of general interest should first be posted to the discussion board (only if\nthey have not already been answered) so that other students can benefit from the response or have an opportunity to respond to your question.\nOnly questions of a private nature should be communicated to me through email. When sending a message to me, please allow a minimum of 24 hours for a response . Most of the time I will respond much faster, but sometimes meetings and other courses take over my schedule.\n\n### Netiquette Guidelines\n\nNetiquette is a set of rules for behaving properly online. Your instructor and\nfellow students wish to foster a safe online learning environment. All opinions\nand experiences, no matter how different or controversial they may be perceived, must be respected in the tolerant spirit of academic discourse. You are encouraged to comment, question, or critique an idea but you are not to attack an individual. Working as a community of learners, we can build a polite and respectful course community.\nThe following netiquette tips will enhance the learning experience for everyone in\nthe course:\n\n- Do not dominate any discussion.\n- Give other students the opportunity to join in the discussion.\n- Do not use offensive language. Present ideas appropriately.\n- Be cautious in using Internet language. For example, do not capitalize all letters\nsince this suggests shouting.\n- Popular emoticons such as ☺ can be helpful to convey your tone but do not overdo\nor overuse them.\n- Never make fun of someone’s ability to read or write.\n- Share tips with other students.\n- Keep an “open-mind” and be willing to express even your academically informed\nopinion.\n- Think and edit before you push the “Send” button.\n- Do not hesitate to ask for feedback.\n- Using humor is acceptable\n(adapted from UWSP )\n\n### Be Proactive in Communication\n\nIf you find that you have any trouble keeping up with assignments or other aspects of the course, make sure you let your instructor know as early as possible. As you will find, building rapport and effective relationships are key to becoming an effective professional. Make sure that you are proactive in informing your instructor when difficulties arise during the semester so that we can help you find a solution. (adapted from UWSP )\n\n### VCU Honor System\n\nVCU recognizes that honesty, truth, and integrity are values central to its mission to advance knowledge and student success both in the world VCU students will enter, or return to, once they have graduated and in the university community as a microcosm of that world. In a community devoted to learning, a foundation of honor must exist if that community is to thrive with respect and harmony. Therefore, all members of the university community must conduct themselves in accordance with the highest standards of academic honesty, ethics, and integrity at all times.(from https://conduct.students.vcu.edu/vcu- honor-system/ )\n\n### Campus emergency information\n\nWhat to know and do to be prepared for emergencies at VCU:\n- Sign up to receive VCU text messaging alerts. Keep your information up-to-date.\nWithin the classroom, the professor will keep his or her phone on to receive any\nemergency\n- Know the safe evacuation route from each of your Emergency evacuation routes are\nposted in on-campus classrooms.\n  \n- Listen for and follow instructions from VCU or other designated Within the classroom, follow your professor's instructions.\n- Know where to go for additional emergency information.\n- Know the emergency phone number for the VCU Police (828-1234).\n- Report suspicious activities and\n- Keep your permanent address and emergency contact information current in\n\n### Important dates\n\nYou can view important dates for the semester in the academic calendar.\n\n### Attendance Policy\n\nAttendance can be gauged in an online or hybrid course by the timely submission of required assignments and the prompt notification of problems in the course. Students are expected to participate in all class activities, submit all assignments before the due date, and complete all tests and examinations in accordance with the class syllabus and outline. Students who cannot participate in or complete assigned class activities, assignments, tests, and examinations by the designated deadlines owing to circumstances should contact the instructor prior to any incidences or immediately following all unforeseen emergencies. Simply logging into the Canvas course does not constitute attendance. Maintaining communication with the instructor via email is a must when absences occur. Please note that it is your responsibility to understand and complete the course assignments. You are expected to read all the material posted in Canvas and check your VCU email for course announcements on a daily basis. If you do not ask questions, it will be assumed that you understand the assignments.\n\n### Military short-term training or deployment\n\nIf military students receive orders for short-term training or for deployment/mobilization, they should inform and present their orders to Military. Student Services and to their professor(s). For further information on policies and procedures contact Military Student Services at 828-5993 or access the corresponding policies.\n\nPlease visit http://go.vcu.edu/syllabus and review all syllabus statement information.
