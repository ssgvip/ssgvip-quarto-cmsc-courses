<section id="requesting-accommodations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="requesting-accommodations">Requesting accommodations</h3>
<p>The university recognizes that some students who previously did not need Section 504 Academic Accommodations, and who have a qualifying condition or disability, may need support or assistance during the return to campus process. A modified approach for the temporary and more permanent need for accommodation has been developed and implemented to provide students with full access to programs and activities related to their academic majors. Because every case is different, student requests are evaluated on a case- by-case basis. Please share your need for an accommodation with the Student Accessibility and Education Office , or for MCV Campus students, the Division for Academic Success , after you have worked directly with your faculty member.</p>

<p>Navigating the anticipated stressors of daily life can often be challenging enough. When unexpected stressors emerge or when we are faced with uncertainty, it can be tough to know how to cope. Try out some of these tips and resources for health and wellness to see if they are a right fit for you.</p>
<p>Symptoms or Diagnosis: If an on-campus student identifies symptoms, has tested positive for COVID-19 or has come into contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19, that student should contact University Student Health Services . At that point, isolation should begin and contact tracing will be performed by Student Health Services. Symptoms will be monitored and the student should refer to a medical provider if symptoms worsen or be released from isolation after 14 days, if symptom-free.</p>

<p>VCU is committed to providing a safe, equitable and inclusive environment for all its employees, patients and students. Discrimination or discriminatory harassment is not only unlawful, it is harmful to the well-being of our university community. Our university’s core values, specifically those related to diversity and inclusion, have withstood many difficult situations and trying times, and they will not falter now. Reports of discrimination, bullying, harassment and/or stereotyping of persons of color or those impacted by COVID-19 or otherwise, will not be tolerated. Be assured that VCU will make every effort to address and prevent the occurrence of unlawful discrimination and, if necessary, take prompt and appropriate action to remedy and prevent its reoccurrence. Every member of our community is asked to: - Become familiar with the university’s policies on Preventing and Responding to Discrimination and Duty to Report and Protection from Retaliation in the VCU Policy Library. - Consult with Equity and Access Services or VCU Human Resources for additional guidance on how to file a report of discrimination. - Contact the Office of Institutional Equity, Effectiveness and Success (IES) on how to address and maintain a culture of inclusion. - Encourage individuals who may need an ADA accommodation for a known or newly acquired disability, to contact the ADA/504 Coordinator in ADA Services. - Bookmark and share information on university or community agencies that offer support or services, such as VCU’s Counseling Services or Ombudsperson. - Explore training and educational opportunities on diversity and inclusion at IExcel Education and through the Office of Institutional Equity, Effectiveness and Success . - Offer nonjudgmental support and empathy to those affected by current events and this health crisis.</p>

<ul>
<li>When taking online and hybrid courses, your self-motivation and self-pacing are absolutely critical. For this course, you should plan to work about 9 hours per course module as we move through the materials. Be sure to plan your time accordingly.</li>
<li>Make yourself a calendar with all of your due dates across ALL of your courses. Plan for when you will work on each one for completion in advance of the due dates.</li>
<li>Make sure you note any “online” course that still have a required meeting time (such as a Google Meet or Zoom session).</li>
<li>Avoid the common assumption that online courses are easier or should be easier. That is a MYTH!!</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="where-to-post-questions">Where to post questions</h3>
<p>Questions of general interest should first be posted to the discussion board (only if they have not already been answered) so that other students can benefit from the response or have an opportunity to respond to your question. Only questions of a private nature should be communicated to me through email. When sending a message to me, please allow a minimum of 24 hours for a response . Most of the time I will respond much faster, but sometimes meetings and other courses take over my schedule.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="netiquette-guidelines">Netiquette Guidelines</h3>
<p>Netiquette is a set of rules for behaving properly online. Your instructor and fellow students wish to foster a safe online learning environment. All opinions and experiences, no matter how different or controversial they may be perceived, must be respected in the tolerant spirit of academic discourse. You are encouraged to comment, question, or critique an idea but you are not to attack an individual. Working as a community of learners, we can build a polite and respectful course community. The following netiquette tips will enhance the learning experience for everyone in the course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not dominate any discussion.</li>
<li>Give other students the opportunity to join in the discussion.</li>
<li>Do not use offensive language. Present ideas appropriately.</li>
<li>Be cautious in using Internet language. For example, do not capitalize all letters since this suggests shouting.</li>
<li>Popular emoticons such as ☺ can be helpful to convey your tone but do not overdo or overuse them.</li>
<li>Never make fun of someone’s ability to read or write.</li>
<li>Share tips with other students.</li>
<li>Keep an “open-mind” and be willing to express even your academically informed opinion.</li>
<li>Think and edit before you push the “Send” button.</li>
<li>Do not hesitate to ask for feedback.</li>
<li>Using humor is acceptable (adapted from UWSP )</li>
