Students will examine the operation of applications such as the web, FTP, e-mail and DNS. At the transport layer, students will study both connectionless UDP and connection-oriented TCP, with an in-depth study of TCP operation, specifically flow control and congestion control. Data communications are explored through various data routing protocols. Additional topics include network security and wireless/mobile networking."

Students should have significant programming experience. This course provides foundation for memory and malware forensics, using the Volatility memory forensics framework, an open source toolkit written in Python. It is focused on investigation of the contents of volatile computer memory (RAM), to reveal hidden malware processes, network connections, clipboard contents, evidence of malware and other malicious evidence. The course will teach skills for analyzing internals of operating systems, such as Mac, Windows and Linux, by concentrating on data structures used by these operating systems."
