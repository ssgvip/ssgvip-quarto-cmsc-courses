Regularly check the course Canvas and watch your email for changes.\nGradeScope will be used for most homework submissions and grading. You should know how to create PDF documents and post PDF documents to Gradescope. You should know how to use Github, as many homework assignments will require submission of material to Gradescope using a Github repository.\nDiscord is the unofficial communications platform for the course. Join the discord and then change your server name to your preferred/real name associated with the course roster.\nThis is a face-to-face course. In class participation is an important part of learning this material and will score points towards your final grade. However, recognizing that life happens I will work to stream the lectures live and record the lectures using Zoom. Recordings will be posted to the course Canvas."

Please do not DM (direct message) me in discord, I cannot guarantee that I will respond. (I also can’t tell who you are!)\nIf you need to contact me directly USE EMAIL. My goal is to respond to your email within 24 hours or much less. If I will be unavailable for a longer stretch of time, I will let the class know in an announcement."

All requests for reasonable accommodations require registration with SAEO in advance of need. Faculty, students and SAEO will work together regarding classroom accommodations. You are encouraged to discuss approved accommodations with your faculty.\n\n\nCounseling Services\nResources for online students can be found through the Online Counseling Center.\n\n\nTutoring\nThe Campus Learning Center offers appointment, drop-in and group tutoring in undergraduate courses across the disciplines. Writing Center The writing center provides assistance at all stages of the writing process, from brainstorming to final draft. Cheating and Plagiarism Plagiarism is stealing and passing off the ideas or words of another as one’s own; it is using another’s production without crediting the source. The best way to avoid plagiarism is to cite properly in any assignment information and concepts that are not your own originally. If a student is discovered to have plagiarized, that student will fail that particular assignment. Academic integrity is expected in all aspects at the university including this course. Don’t expect less of yourself than you do of your students For more information: https://students.vcu.edu/studentconduct/"

I appreciate and promote collaboration between students on ALL activities. It’s good to share ideas and strategies. New and different experiences and perspectives will help you grow and expand your own perspectives.\nIndividual assignments often require internal reflection, writing and coding. For individual assignments, I expect you to create your own code (not cut and paste from friend) and present YOUR OWN ideas as part of the submission. I’ll be providing feedback on your ideas.\nGroup assignments often require brainstorming, strategizing and problem solving, and debating. For group assignments I expect everyone on the team to participate in one role or another.\nUltimately, YOU are responsible for your own learning. I can guide you and your classmates can contribute to your learning, but in the end, the responsibility and the grade are yours alone.\n\n\nAccessibility Concerns\nI will do all I can to accommodate any special learning needs.
