Tasks include team meetings, brainstorming, sponsor advising, researching, designing, implementing, reviewing, testing and validating projects. Each student will participate, either individually or as part of a team, in a project or other experience approved by the course coordinator or sponsored by another computer science faculty member. Students must continue on the same project that was started in CMSC 441 and CMSC 451. A final project report and presentation are due at the conclusion of the two-semester project or experience.

    "text": "CMSC 678-Statistical Learning and Fuzzy Logic Algorithms\nSemester course. 3 hours.\nRestrictions: MATH/STAT 309 or MATH 310.\nDescription: The course considers two central problems in modern science and engineering: i) the problem of statistical learning from examples (empirical data) and ii) the problem of embedding existing human knowledge into workable mathematics. Topics include: examples of multivariate functional mapping, basics of classic classification and regression, support vector machines as a learning paradigm based on structural risk minimization, fuzzy logic algorithms, basics of multi-class classification over high dimensional spaces, curve and surface fittings, multivariate function approximation and nonlinear optimization; fuzzy logic systems; crisp and fuzzy sets, linguistic variables, fuzzy set theory; if-then rules, fuzzy interference, fuzzification and defuzzification, neuro-fuzzy paradigms."
