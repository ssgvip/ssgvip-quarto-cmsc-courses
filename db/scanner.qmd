A list of CMSC courses was downloaded from the [campus bulletin](http://bulletin.vcu.edu/azcourses/cmsc/).

The list was loaded into XLSX and cleaned. The following sections
provide a view of the CMSC courses from the Bulletin.

The script below loads the cleaned XLSX.

```{python}

import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import Markdown
from tabulate import tabulate

filename = "cmsc-bulletin-spring-2023.xlsx"
xlsx = pd.ExcelFile( filename )
df1 = pd.read_excel(xlsx,"CMSC-Courses")
```

```{python}
#| echo: false

collist = "', '".join(df1.columns)
display(Markdown(f"Here is a list of columns:<br/>'{collist}'."))
```

## CMSC Courses in the Bulletin

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-table1
#| tbl-cap: List of courses

cols = ["ID","Title"]

display(Markdown(f"""
@tbl-table1 presents a list of CMSC courses in the bulletin.
There are {len(df1.index)} courses in the bulletin.

"""
))

Markdown(tabulate(
  df1[ cols ],
  showindex=False,
  headers=cols
))


```

# Course Descriptions with Restrictions

The section below uses the panda dataframe from above and lists
out courses, restrictions, and descriptions.

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Display each course using markdown.

## The entire block of markdown is created and rendered.
## There can be only one "display(Markdown())" call per code block.
## The spacing is expanded to accomodate the Markdown processor.

block = "";
for index, row in df1.iterrows():
  block = block + f"""
## {row["ID"]} - {row["Title"]}
   
**Restrictions:** {row["Restrictions"]}

**Description:** {row["Isolated Description"]}


"""
display(Markdown( block ))
```
