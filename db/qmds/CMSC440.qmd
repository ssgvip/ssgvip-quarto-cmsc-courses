## Catalog Description

Semester course; 3 lecture hours. 3 credits. Prerequisite: CMSC 257 with a minimum grade of C. Enrollment is restricted to majors in the College of Engineering. This course explores computer networking, focusing on the applications and protocols that run on the Internet. Students will take a top-down approach to the layered network architecture, studying applications first and then proceeding down the network “stack” toward the physical link. Students will examine the operation of applications such as the web, FTP, e-mail and DNS. At the transport layer, students will study both connectionless UDP and connection-oriented TCP, with an in-depth study of TCP operation, specifically flow control and congestion control. Data communications are explored through various data routing protocols. Additional topics include network security and wireless/mobile networking.
