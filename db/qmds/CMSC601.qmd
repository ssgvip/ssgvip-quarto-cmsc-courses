## Catalog Description

Semester course; 3 lecture hours. 3 credits. Prerequisite: CMSC 501 or permission of instructor. Enrollment restricted to students with graduate standing in computer science or related discipline. A background in undergraduate-level linear algebra is assumed. Convex sets and functions. Convex optimization problems: Linear, quadratic, semi-definite and cone programs. Duality theory. Approximation algorithms for NP-complete integer optimization problems via semi-definite relaxations and rounding schemes. Algorithms for optimization, such as gradient descent, proximal descent, alternating directions method of multipliers, interior point methods.
