# SSGVIP CMSC course materials project

Central repo for CMSC course materials in standard format.  The web site is built using python and [Quarto](https://quarto.org).

This repository publishes a web site from the *docs* folder. See: <https://ssgvip.github.io/ssgvip-quarto-cmsc-courses>.

* *db* folder contains the scripts that create the database. See the [code page on the web site](https://ssgvip.github.io/ssgvip-quarto-cmsc-courses/scanner.html) for details.

* *docs* folder contains the web site autogenerated from the code in the *db* folder. This folder also contains the PDF syllabi, stored in folders by term.

* *precious* folder contains the original PDF syllabi. There are inconsistencies across names, so these files were dropped into appropriate folders in the *docs* directory and then renamed as appropriate. The *snapshop.7z" file in the *precious* folder contains a snapshot of the clean file names. This is handy if we need to rebuild the entire site.

See See the [code page on the web site](https://ssgvip.github.io/ssgvip-quarto-cmsc-courses/scanner.html) for details on how the web site is built, etc.
